# Basic Web Application Project
#### Data Representation and Querying Project 2016

This repository contains code and information for a third-year undergraduate project for the module **Data Representation and Querying**.
The module is taught to undergraduate students at [GMIT](http://www.gmit.ie) in the Department of Computer Science and Applied Physics.
The lecturer is [Ian McLoughlin](https://ianmcloughlin.github.io).

### Project overview
I have created a single-Page Web Application (SPA) that lets users calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI).
I created the web app using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) which is a microframework for [Python](https://www.python.org/).

### How to run the application
Must install [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
